Chrome runner
=============

The idea of this script is to make the starting of Google Chrome browser 
without security much easier than it was before. The script checks if there
is running instances of chrome.exe and if there is a present instance,
alerts the user that the running instance must be killed before Google Crome
is started. If the user clicks on Yes button, the script will kill all instances of 
chrome.exe. After this, will open a new browser instance without security. 
If the user clicks on No button, the script will do nothing. If there is no   
present running instance of chrome.exe, the script will start 
Google Chrome without security. How to use it? Just clone this repository 
and fill correct path to chrome.exe. The script is tested on windows 8 
with admin rigths. Don't hesitate to write to me with suggestions and
feature requests. I will be happy if someone use this. :)
